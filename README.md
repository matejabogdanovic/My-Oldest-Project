# My Oldest Project - Quiz

## Context
This project holds a special place in my heart because It's the oldest project I was able to recover. \
I found a video in my phone gallery, as well as a photo of a diagram representing the logic behind certain decisions. \
The date said - year **2017**. Keep in mind that I was barely **14** years old at the time.

Nobody had taught me what a function was, let alone good programming practices or code formatting (as you will see in the source code). \
I don't even think I knew that I could assign a new value to a variable - I just used addition 🙂.‍ \
That's the reason why you will see lines like `z=t+t1;` where `t=0` and `t1=1`. I just wanted to set `z` flag to `1`! 

## How to run
To get started, compile the `main.cpp` or `main_en.cpp` for English translation. \
If you are using `CLion`, make sure to configure run options and enable **Emulate Terminal** option!
