# My Oldest Project - Quiz

## Context
This project holds special place in my heart. \
It's my oldest project that I was able to recover. \
I've found a video in my phone gallery, as well as a photo of a diagram that represents the logic behind certain decisions. \
The date said - year **2017**. Keep in mind that I was barely **14** years old at the time. \
Nobody had taught me what a function is, let alone good programming practices or code formatting (as you can see from the source code). \
I don't even think I knew that I could assign a new value to a variable - I just used addition 🙂.‍ \
That's the reason why you will see lines like `z=t+t1;` where `t=0` and `t1=1`. I just wanted to set `z` flag to `1`! \

## How to run
To get started, compile the `main.cpp` or `main_en.cpp` for English translation. \
If you are using `CLion`, make sure to configure run options and enable **Emulate Terminal** option! \
